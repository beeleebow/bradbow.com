I didn't want a menu with more than three items in it, so I'm
going to put everything else here. Don't worry, I'll use headings.

## Pluralsight

I upped my Git game a couple of years ago and helped a few
colleagues to do the same. In doing so I discovered an enjoyment
for teaching and story-telling. I also have a general fondness
for money. I brought these two things together and authored a
[Pluralsight course on Rewriting Git History](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/rewriting-git-history/table-of-contents).

I'm considering authoring another course in the near future.

## Functional Programming Adventures

I've been diving into the big wide world of FP (that's Functional
Programming speak for Functional Programming). I still have quite
a way to go, but here are some projects/courses I've done and
can recommend.

<div class=callout>
[CIS194 Course](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html)

This is a course taught by Brent Yorgey at the University of Pennsylvania.
It pretty much starts from scratch and gets you up to Monads.
Some colleagues and I put together a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/stacktracehq/cis194-exercises) that
contains unit tests for each of the weekly homework assignments,
so you can TDD your way to victory.

<div class=callout>
[Data61/QFPL Intro Course](https://github.com/data61/fp-course)

This is a set of exercises that use Haskell to teach core functional programming
concepts. It serves as the content for a 3-day Introduction to Functional Programming
workshop run by the [Queensland Functional Programming Lab](https://qfpl.io) (QFPL),
which I can highly recommend.

<div class=callout>
[Data61/QFPL Applied Course](https://github.com/qfpl/applied-fp-course)

This repository backs another 3-day workshop run by the
QFPL. It builds on the topics covered in the introductory course and
guides you through building a real web-service, which encodes/decodes JSON
and talks to a SQL database.

## Books

I'd love to say I've read The Blue Book, or Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs. But I haven't, OK? I probably never will. And, yes,
I know I should.

I'm currently reading:

* [The Richest Man in Bablyon](https://www.dymocks.com.au/book/the-richest-man-in-babylon-by-george-s-clason-and-george-s-clason-and-margaret-drabble-9780451205360), by George S. Clason.
* [My Job Went to India](https://www.amazon.com/Job-Went-India-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0976694018), by Chad Fowler.
