I live in Brisbane, Australia, where I work as a Senior Software
Engineer for [Stacktrace](https://stacktracehq.com). My current day-to-day is
working with C#/dotnet core and Angular, deployed on Azure.

I have built software for several industries, using a slew of
languages, frameworks, and tools. I enjoy building useful software as simply as possible.
In my experience this is unreasonably hard to do.
