title: "Recommended FP Courses"
---

I've been diving into the big wide world of FP (that's Functional
Programming speak for Functional Programming). I still have quite
a way to go, but here are some projects/courses I've done and
can recommend.

[CIS194 Course](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html)

This is a course taught by Brent Yorgey at the University of Pennsylvania.
It pretty much starts from scratch and gets you up to Monads.
Some colleagues and I put together a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/stacktracehq/cis194-exercises) that
contains unit tests for each of the weekly homework assignments,
so you can TDD your way to victory.

[Data61/QFPL Intro Course](https://github.com/data61/fp-course)

This is a set of exercises that use Haskell to teach core functional programming
concepts. It serves as the content for a 3-day Introduction to Functional Programming
workshop run by the [Queensland Functional Programming Lab](https://qfpl.io) (QFPL),
which I can highly recommend.

[Data61/QFPL Applied Course](https://github.com/qfpl/applied-fp-course)

This repository backs another 3-day workshop run by the
QFPL. It builds on the topics covered in the introductory course and
guides you through building a real web-service, which encodes/decodes JSON
and talks to a SQL database.
