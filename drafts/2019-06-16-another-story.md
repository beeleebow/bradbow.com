title: "Another Story"

# TL;DR

<div class="tldr">
</div>

Let me paint you a picture. You've been working on a story for a few
days, and you've made some good progress. The guts of the feature are
there. Sure, there a few things to polish in the UI and there is that
error handling on the server-side that could really use a quick refactor,
but other than that it's looking good.

Just before lunch, you notice something. Something troubling. If you poke
it here, then poke it there, everything breaks. There aren't any errors
logged, but the server just never returns a response. _Weird_. But, hey, the
way you poked it was pretty weird. That probably wouldn't actually happen
in production, or if it did it wouldn't happen that often. Right?

Yes, the more you think about, the more this feels like an "edge case"
(the Software Developer's only natural predator). It's probably not
even worth mentioning to your team-mates. After all, the story description doesn't
even say what _should_ happen in that case.
It's the last day of the sprint and it sure would be nice to add
those story points to the done tally.

Edge case it is. But you're not just going to forget about it. No, no, that
would be irresponsible and you're a professional.
The edge case can be... duh, duH, DUH: **another story!**

If you can honestly say that this doesn't ring any bells then
you are better at this software thing that I am, and, on those grounds, I
hate you.

For everyone else, let's think about the this decision point that we
all encounter frequently. Are our stories doomed to be preverbial
Hydras, always spawning more work then they themselves capture?
Why is it so hard to do something until it is done?

## Someone's keeping score and you need the points

## You're tired

## You don't actually know how to solve that bit
