# TL;DR

<div class="tldr">
</div>

Let me paint you a picture. You've been working on a story for a few
days, and you've made some good progress. The guts of the feature are
there. Sure, there a few things to polish in the UI and there is that
error handling on the server-side that could really use a quick refactor,
but other than that it's looking good.

That can be another story. If you work in Software and haven't heard that
phrase I will eat my hat. How does it make you feel when you hear that?
Relieved? Angry? Incomplete (more than usual)?

Why do we do it? I can think of a few reasons.

## Someone's keeping score and you need the points

## You're tired

## You don't actually know how to solve that bit
