  This blog is my obligatory internet presence. Commenting on posts is not supported
  and commonplace features like tagging and searching are also noticebly
  absent. These are not oversights.

  I will not capture any information about you, so
  your visit to this underwhelming corner of the internet can remain a secret.
  This is the best outcome for us both.
